## First\(\!\) pure API\(\!\) Find/Replace dialog


</div>

### Description

Since Bruce McKinney stop his attempts to implement standard Find/Replace dialog into VB apps, all VB programmers use their own dialogs based on modelless windows. Few samples in the Net may work with NT/2000, but crash with w95/98. Here is working code for implementing these dialogs w95/98/2000/NT. Support dialog's keys (Tab, Enter, HotKeys). Include functions for finding/replace text in text controls (TextBox and RTB). Not wide tested yet on all platforms. Plz send comments.
 
### More Info
 
String(s) to find(replace with) and start dialog flags (searc direction, match case, help button etc).

Output string(s) to find(replace with) and output dialog flags, according to user choice.
